# leetcode-difficulty-tag-remover-extension

Are you feeling demotivated to see *HARD* tag while grinding Leetcode?

Are you feeling not excited to solve *EASY* tagged problems in LC?

I too felt the same. So, the solution is here:

This Leetcode Difficulty-tag hider Chrome extension is a simple and easy-to-use tool that helps users hide the difficulty tag on Leetcode problems. 

For those who do not know: Leetcode is a popular website for practicing coding problems and preparing for technical interviews. However, some users find it distracting or intimidating to see the difficulty level of each problem. This extension allows users to hide the difficulty tag on Leetcode problems, so we can focus on the problem itself and not be influenced by its perceived level of difficulty.
